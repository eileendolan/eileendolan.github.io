Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

I used HTML and CSS to create a visualization dashboard website for a previous project (WeatherPy). In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which users can navigate between them. These pages contained visualizations and their corresponding explanations. In addition, I created a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots and a another page where we can view the data used to build them. 

•	A landing page containing:
An explanation of the WeatherPy project and links to each visualization page.

•	Four visualization pages, each with:
-A descriptive title and heading tag.
-The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison. 
-A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

•	A comparison page that:
-Contains all of the visualizations on the same page, so users can visually compare the four plots in ease. 
-Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations. 

•	A data page that:
-Displays a responsive table containing the data used in visualization. 

* Note: The table was a bootstrap table component, and the data came from the exported  `.csv` file to convert to HTML. One way to covert the CSV file to a HTML table is through Pandas notebook and one other way is using a conversion tool, e.g. [ConvertCSV].(http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-html.htm).
